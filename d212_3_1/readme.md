# WGU D212 Task 3 Rev 1 - Mattinson

Abstract
Transaction data will be analyzed using Apriori algorithm also known as “Market Basket Analysis” or “Association Rules”. Approximately 7,500 customer transactions will be considered. There are approx. 119 unique items used in those transactions. The top association rules will be generated and reviewed. Minimum support of 3/1000. Minimum confidence of 3/10. Rules with lift values above 1 are considered to have strong correlation between the antecedents and consequents. Specifically, blue-light reading glasses have a six (6) times likelihood of purchase when computer accessories of “Dust-Off Compressed Gas 2 pack” and “Anker 2-in-1 USB Card Reader” are purchased.

Keywords: Data Mining. Market Basket Analysis. Association Rules and Lift Analysis.
