Abstract
Telecom customer data will be analyzed for feature selection using principal component analysis (PCA). The dataset consists of 50 features associated with 10,000 customer records. The analysis looked at the 50 features and select 13 continuous features to be used by the PCA. PCA results indicate that 11 principal components are needed to explained approx. 95% of the total variance. 10 principal components are needed to explain approx. 85% of total variance. Eigenvalue analysis suggests using only the first six (6) PCs. The first principal component (PC1) has high correlation to the original features of Tenure and Bandwidth_GB_Year. The second principal component (PC2) has high correlation to population and location.
